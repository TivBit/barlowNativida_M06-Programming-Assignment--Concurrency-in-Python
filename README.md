M06 Programming Assignment -Concurrency in Python

Bug Report:
There were several issues getting the programs to run in Jupyter Notebook.  At first I was trying to get the lines to run in seperate cells.  Eventually I figured out that I had to put the entire program in one cell.  I made each program run in its own cell.  Finally, it appears that the programs run with no issues. ~T.
